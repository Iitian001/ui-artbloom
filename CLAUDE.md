## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. Route only to skills in the session's available-skills list; answer directly for quick questions or small scoped edits.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship

Do not suggest or auto-invoke other gstack skills: they run when the user types them, or when a running skill hands off to them (`gstack-config set proactive all` routes every skill).
